# eight-bar-line

Music notation website allowing for custom 8 bars of music to be played with other users.

## Installation
```bash
# Start in the root directory
cd eight-bar-line
npm install
```

## Development

To start the dev

These commands will start the backend and frontend projects and listen to changes in either directory.
```bash
npm run dev:backend
npm run dev:frontend
```

However, this does not listen to changes in the `common` directory automatically. If you want to make changes to the `common` directory, you will need to run this command in the project root directory:
```bash
npm run build:common
```

## Deployment

Running these three commands in order will make sure all the code is built and hosted properly.
The start script will run the backend, which will find the static code generated by the frontends to host at the given PORT
```bash
npm install
npm run build
npm run start
```
