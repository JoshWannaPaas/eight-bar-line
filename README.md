# eight-bar-line

Music notation website allowing for custom 8 bars of music to be played with other users.

## Installation

To begin, install all of the node modules. I've configured this command to recursively install node modules for both the frontends and backends.

```bash
# Start in the root directory
cd eight-bar-line
npm install
```

## Development

There are two parts to the stack that are relevant for local development:
- The Backend Node Server
- The Frontend React Client

### Start the Development Servers

While in development mode, we have a service that will observe any file changes and automatically refresh the preview. To start the development mode for the frontend or backend, run these commands in separate terminals:
```bash
npm run dev:backend
npm run dev:frontend
```

For convenience, you can run this command, which will handle starting **both** the backend and frontend development servers concurrently in the same terminal:
```bash
npm run dev
```

However, while in development mode, changes in the `common` directory are not immediately reloaded. If you want to make changes to the `common` directory, you will need to run this command in the project root directory:
```bash
npm run build:common
```

## Deployment

Running these three commands in order will make sure all the code is built and hosted properly.
The start script will run the backend, which will find the static code generated by the frontends to host at the given PORT
```bash
npm install
npm run build
npm run start
```
