# Sequelize Models

This directory contains models for each table we want to store in our database. 

## `User.ts`

The User model stores persistent info for any Barline authors and allows associating data with a user.

## TBD `Barline.ts`

This table will store information for an individual Barline and associate it with its author. 

## TBD `Ensemble.ts`

This table will associate multiple Barlines together. It will also allow for assigning the volume for each Barline, the overall tempo for the piece, etc.
